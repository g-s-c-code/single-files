# LoTR Risk Battle Simulator

A responsive single-file application created with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. This application serves as a virtual dice roller for the board game Risk: The Lord of the Rings Ed. If you've lost one of the dice for your physical game (like I did...), this app can step in to fill the void.
