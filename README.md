# LoTR Dice Roller

A simple, single-file application created with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. This application serves as a virtual dice roller for the board game "The Lord of the Rings Risk." If you've lost one of the dice for your physical game (like I did...), this app can step in to fill the void.

## Features
- Single file: Just download the HTML file, open it in the web browser of your choice and you are ready to go.
- Roll virtual dice for the attacker and defender.
- The app automatically determines casualties.
- Select the number of dice for both the attacker and defender.
- Option to add a +1 "leader" bonus to either the attacker or defender, or grant the defender a +1 bonus for being in a fortress.
