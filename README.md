# LoTRDiceRoller
A simple, single-file application created with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. Born out of necessity when a die went missing from the LoTR Risk board game, this app steps in to fill the void. Roll virtual dice for both attacker and defender, simulate epic battles, and calculate casualties.
